**Spectrogram** is selected as preprocessing feature of audio samples and a feature representation method based on deep residual network (**Spec-ResNet**) is implemented here to detect audio steganography based on AAC(Advanced Audio Coding).

First of all, we analysed existing audio steganography based on AAC. Although the embedding domain is different, the final impact of existing schemes are the change of the MDCT coefficients of the encoded audio signals in different frequency range. Spectrogram, a basic visual representation of the spectrum of frequencies of audio signals which can show the energy amplitude information of different frequency bands changing over time is chosen as analysis object of ResNet to get 40-dimension classification feature to decide whether or not a piece of audio contains secret message.

Still, this is a work on progress, we will update it lately. You will find responding paper "Spec-ResNet: A General Audio Steganalysis scheme based on Deep Residual Network of Spectrogram" by Yanzhen Ren, Dengkai Liu, Qiaochu Xiong, Jianming Fu, Lina Wang in [https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.06838](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.06838).

# Requirements
Specifically, this project is based on Tensorflow 1.0.0 + CUDA 8.0.61 + CuDNN 5.1.10 + Python 2.7.15. The code has been tested on Ubuntu 16.04.
     
# Data set
There is 15 data directory `algo_ebr` besides `cover`: `lsbee_0.1`, `lsbee_0.2`, `lsb_ee_0.3`，`lsb_ee_0.5`，`lsb_ee_1.0`，`min_0.1`, `min_o.2`, `min_0.3`, `min_0.5`, `min_1.0`,`sign_0.1`, `sign_0.2`, `sign_0.3`, `sign_0.5`, `sign_1.0`. In `algo_ebr`, `algo`: [lsb_ee](https://www.computer.org/csdl/proceedings/mines/2010/4258/00/4258a841-abs.html), [min](http://en.cnki.com.cn/Article_en/CJFDTOTAL-XXWX201107046.htm), [sign](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5629745) represents the steganographic algorithm from which this sample is generated and `ebr` is the relative embedding rate: 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.5, 1.0.

Each data directory contains 10000 files(1.txt, 2.txt, ..., 10000.txt). Because the whole data set is too large to be uploaded here, we put it on other platform [https://pan.baidu.com/s/1a6oT_iQcZLXB9CXs6Fg_rA](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1a6oT_iQcZLXB9CXs6Fg_rA) and a subset is uploaded, including decoded wave file, spectrogram feature extraction script in **AAC (2s, stereo, 1024Kbps, decoded WAV).rar**, and responding spectrogram matrix with window size `N=512` in **Spectrogram.rar**.

# Experiments
For AAC based steganographic algorithm, we choosed above three as objects. Considering the capicity of MP3stego, we choosed several emerging MP3 adaptive steganography([AHCM](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8626153), [EECS](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-64185-0_16)) with distortion minimization to test the detection ability. The [dataset](https://github.com/Charleswyt/tf_audio_steganalysis) we choose was also changed. It wil be coming soon...
